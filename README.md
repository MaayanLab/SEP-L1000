# Side effect prediction based on L1000 data
This web portal is made to serve the adverse event predictions for the >20,000 LINCS compounds.

## About
On the home page, a network of predictive ADRs was constructed based on their drug similarity and visualized using a stacked bubble chart. Each drug and ADR has a dedicated page with a list of the relevant predictions and external links to sites such as: [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [lincscloud.org](lincscloud.org), LINCS Information Framework([LIFE](http://life.ccs.miami.edu/life/)) and [SIDER](http://sideeffects.embl.de/).
